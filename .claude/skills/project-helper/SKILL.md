# Project Helper

A local skill that provides project-specific guidance.

## Instructions

1. Read the project's README.md for context
2. Check Cargo.toml for dependencies and configuration
3. Review src/ directory structure

## Project Conventions

- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` to check for lints
- Tests go in the same file as the code they test
